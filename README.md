# üßæ Uber Receipt Downloader

This app allows you to **automatically download receipt PDFs from Uber for Business** using a properly formatted CSV file. It automates login via Chrome, maintains session cookies between runs, and saves each PDF using user-friendly filenames.

---

## üöÄ Requirements

- **Google Chrome** must be installed.
- macOS or Windows with Python 3.8+
- A valid CSV file with the required structure.
- Internet access to download receipts from Uber.

## üìÅ CSV Format Requirements

Your input `.csv` file must have the following **columns with exact header names**:

| Column Header                 | Description                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Receipt`                    | Direct URL to the PDF receipt (must work when logged into Uber Business) |
| `Last Name`                  | Used in naming the downloaded file       |
| `Transaction Timestamp (UTC)`| ISO-style timestamp used in filename     |

‚úÖ Example:

```csv
Receipt,Last Name,Transaction Timestamp (UTC)
https://business.uber.com/receipt/abc123,Smith,2025-07-01T14:22:33Z
https://business.uber.com/receipt/def456,Brown,2025-07-02T09:33:36Z
```

The following header is from a working Uber downlaoded CSV file:  
```CSV
Trip/Eats ID,Transaction Timestamp (UTC),Request Date (UTC),Request Time (UTC),Request Date (Local),Request Time (Local),Drop-off Date (UTC),Drop-off Time (UTC),Drop-off Date (Local),Drop-off Time (Local),Request Timezone Offset from UTC,First Name,Last Name,Email,Employee ID,Service,City,Distance (mi),Duration (min),Pickup Address,Drop-off Address,Expense Code,Expense Memo,Invoices,Program,Group,Payment Method,Transaction Type,Fare in Local Currency (excl.

Taxes, if any) in USD",Invoice Number,Deductions in Local Currency,Network Transaction Id,IsGroupOrder,Fulfilment Type,Country,Cancellation type,Membership Savings(Local Currency),Receipt

```
You must ensure to remove any blank lines, additional header lines, or lines with dash values. For example, the following will NOT work:
```
ompany:,Creative Technology
Administrator:,
Report Date:,2025-07-18 15:49:37.304747439 +0000 UTC 49=+37.304747439

üö´ The app will fail if:

Any of these columns are missing or renamed
Any rows have missing (blank) values in these columns

## üß™ First Run

When launched, the app will open Google Chrome.
You'll be prompted to log into your Uber for Business account.
After login, the app will save session cookies to your local system so you won‚Äôt need to log in again for future runs.

## üóÇ Output

All receipts will be downloaded as PDFs and saved in your selected folder. Files are named using:

<Last Name>_<Timestamp>.pdf  
Example:

Smith_2025-07-01_14-22-33.pdf

## üîê Cookie Storage

Session cookies are stored locally at:

~/.uber_receipts_cookies.pkl  
To clear login and force re-authentication, simply delete that file.  

## üí¨ Troubleshooting

| Problem                               | Solution                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `No module named 'pandas'`            | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`                                                |
| App opens Chrome but doesn‚Äôt download | Make sure you're logged into the **correct Uber account** and that cookies are valid |
| Still seeing login page               | Delete cookie file at `~/.uber_receipts_cookies.pkl` and relaunch the app            |
| Filenames not saving correctly        | Ensure the CSV file has **no blank values** and all required headers                 |
